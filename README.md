# REDI_extra

Repository containing projects I made while studying web development, including node.js and backend. Two backend projects are based on a webpage with random quotes that automatically change if user is inactive, or change when user presses button. New quotes can be added and are stored locally. One project (fetching) is getting data from the server, another (web server) is posting data to the server.
